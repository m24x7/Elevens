Buggy1)
Possible error: incorrect spelling of cards.size in constructor of deck, incorect spelling of size in isEmpty().
Buggy2)
Possible error: constructor doesn't create a new card with the given strings and integer, .size method not returning size.

Possible error: testshuffle method uses .deal which returns size not a card causing both cards to be the same number.
Buggy4)
Possible error: .deal causes the one card deck to have zero cards thus returning null when the size is tested.
